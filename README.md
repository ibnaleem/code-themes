## ü§ù Contributing
I welcome contributions from the community and appreciate the time and effort put into making [code-themes](https://github.com/ibnaleem/code-themes) better. To contribute, please follow the guidelines and steps outlined below:

### Fork the Repository
Start by [forking this repository](https://github.com/ibnaleem/code-themes/fork). You can do this by clicking on the ["Fork"](https://github.com/ibnaleem/code-themes/fork) button located at the top right corner of the GitHub page. This will create a personal copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

### Clone the Repository
Next, clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-themes.git
```
Navigate to the cloned directory:
```bash 
$ cd code-themes
```
### Create a New Branch
Before making any changes, it's recommended to create a new branch. This ensures that your changes won't interfere with other contributions and keeps the main branch clean. Use the following command to create and switch to a new branch:
```bash
$ git checkout -b branch-name
```
### Format for Contributions
1. Upload the theme's screenshot in one of the directories it belongs to (if it's a dark theme, upload it to [DARK](https://github.com/ibnaleem/code-themes/tree/main/DARK))
2. Edit the markdown file it belongs to, and add the following lines:
```html
<h2>THEME NAME</h2>
  <img src="link to screenshot" height="50%" width="50%"> // DO NOT CHANGE WIDTH AND HEIGHT
  <p><a href="link to VS Code theme">VS Code</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="link to nvim theme">NVIM</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="link to JetBrains theme">JetBrains</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="link to Replit theme">Replit</a></p>
```
> Feel free to add or remove platforms (i.e if your theme does not support NVIM, remove the NVIM line, and if there are more platforms it supports, add those too

### Commit and Push Changes
Once you have made the necessary changes, commit your work using the following commands:
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
Push the changes to your forked repository:
```bash
$ git push origin branch-name
```
